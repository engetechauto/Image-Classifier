# Image-Classifier
This project is a deep learning-based image classifier built using TensorFlow and Keras. It processes image data, trains a convolutional neural network (CNN), and classifies images into different categories. The model is implemented in Google Colab with visualization and evaluation techniques to ensure accurate predictions.
