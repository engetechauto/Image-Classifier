# Image Classifier using TensorFlow

## Project Overview
This project is a basic image classifier built using TensorFlow and Google Colab. The classifier is trained on a dataset to recognize different categories of images. The objective is to apply deep learning techniques for image recognition and understand the workflow of training a convolutional neural network (CNN).

## Technologies Used
- **Python** (for data processing and model development)
- **TensorFlow & Keras** (for deep learning and model training)
- **Google Colab** (for cloud-based training)
- **NumPy & pandas** (for data handling)
- **matplotlib & seaborn** (for visualizing results)

## Project Workflow
1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Loading the dataset (e.g., CIFAR-10, MNIST, or a custom dataset)
   - Normalizing image pixel values
   - Splitting into training and testing sets

2. **Building the CNN Model**
   - Designing a deep learning model with TensorFlow and Keras
   - Adding convolutional layers, pooling layers, and dense layers
   - Using activation functions like ReLU and softmax

3. **Training the Model**
   - Compiling the model with an optimizer and loss function
   - Training the model on the dataset
   - Evaluating accuracy and loss

4. **Model Evaluation & Testing**
   - Testing on new images
   - Generating confusion matrices and accuracy scores
   - Visualizing predictions with sample images

## How to Use
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/image-classifier.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd image-classifier
   ```
3. Install required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install tensorflow numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn
   ```
4. Open Google Colab and run the Jupyter Notebook to train and test the model.

## Sample Predictions
Include sample images showing the classifierâ€™s predictions.
